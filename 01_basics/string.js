const name = "Rajesh";
const age = 28;

// console.log(name + age ); dont use this type of syntax bcos this old dated 

// In concatination we should use backticks (``) 

console.log(`Hello my name is ${name} and my age is ${age}`); // this is better and readable code & 
                                                            // this is called as string Interpolation

// If we want to display name in upper case

console.log(`Hello my name is ${name.toUpperCase()} and my age is ${age}`); // We can do this
